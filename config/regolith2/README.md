# Regolith2 Setup

In addition to installing the configuration files, you will need to do a few
other things.

1. Install a [NerdFont](https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads).

## NerdFont

Download the font you want and unzip it into `~/.fonts`. Then add the directory
to your font cache

```bash
fc-cache --force ~/.fonts
```
